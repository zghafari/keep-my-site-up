# keep-my-site-up
Simple bash and batch script to keep shared hosting servers like GoDaddy from going to sleep

## Introduction
GoDaddy servers tend to go to sleep after more than 5 minutes. These scripts curl the server and make sure they stay active reducing load times from 10 seconds to .5 - 1 second.

## Usage
Change the variables within the scripts and run them!
